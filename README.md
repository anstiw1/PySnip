# PySnip

***Please note this is a work in progress, and not yet complete!***

Text and images share a strange relationship. While we want to be able to edit documents on the fly (think Google Docs, or even MS Word), we want to send them to folks where they look best (think PDF). PDFs have a significant advantage over documents because they are multi-dimensional and can integrate text, images, vector graphics and even animations into one format. They also don't lose graphical integrity, or formatting regardless of what device they are opened on. PDFs are so secure and offer differing levels of access to protect content, and they're relatively compact for the amnount of information they contain. 

Unfortunately, PDFs have one giant drawback: the ability to edit these documents is severely limited as the original goal of the file format was to protect the contest on the page. Even extracting info from PDFs is difficult and cumbersome. 

PySnip's purpose is to read the text content on an image, and allow the user to edit in a word processor of their choosing!
